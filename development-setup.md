# Development Setup

## The Current One

The idea is to centralize all work within a couple applications and use Alt+Tab to switch between them. The Arc + VSCode setup plays along this idea very well: Arc is being used for browsing, development, communication etc., and VSCode is being used as a text editor with an integrated terminal.

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [zsh + omz](https://ohmyz.sh/)

So far, the parts I could iterate on here are VSCode and shell setup.

## The Next One

Maybe try neovim ?

Maybe try fish ?
